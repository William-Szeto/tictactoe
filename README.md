# tictactoe
What if you played tic-tac-toe by choosing a sequence of spaces to play, before you start playing?
I number the spaces top to bottom, left to right from 0 to 8. A "strategy" is defined as a ranking of spaces from most desirable to least desirable - in a game of tic-tac-toe, you choose the free space that is highest on your list.
For example, a game between strategies "012345678" first and "876543210" second would end with strategy "012345678" winning since they fill in the 0-1-2 row.

I am pretty sure that for any strategy, there is another strategy to beat it.

Things I want to do:
- Prove that there is no strategy that is "unbeatable".
- Find the "best" strategies (the ones that win/draw against the most other strategies).
- Learn how better to use Github
